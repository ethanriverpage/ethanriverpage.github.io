Tech hobbyist turned problem solver. Currently studying for AWS Solutions Architect & Developer certifications with Emory University & Fullstack Academy. As a life principle, I attempt to optimize & automate everything I canâ€”an expert in learning by collaboration and eventually Googling the solution. I started with a homelab -- ended up with skills such as Linux, Docker (& docker-compose), virtualization (Proxmox), NGINX, etc. Now looking to learn/develop my skills in CI/CD, Terraform, Kubernetes & cloud services such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. 

Beyond tech, I currently work in youth ministry -- something I've been passionate about throughout my life. Through youth ministry, I've learned much about working as a team, strong leadership, and other valuable soft skills. Some of my hobbies include volleyball, audio engineering, electronics repair, and woodworking, among others. Passion and desire for improvement are what have driven me to where I am today.
